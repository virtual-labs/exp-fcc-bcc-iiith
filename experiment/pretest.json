      "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Atoms are located only at the corners of the cube",
        "b": "Atoms are located at the corners and at the center of the cube",
        "c": "Atoms are located at the corners and at the center of each face",
        "d": "Atoms are located only at the center of the cube"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "FCC structures have atoms at the corners of the cube and at the center of each face, providing a highly efficient packing arrangement."

      "question": "What is the coordination number of a simple cubic (SC) crystal structure?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "4",
        "b": "6",
        "c": "8",
        "d": "12"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "A simple cubic structure has a coordination number of 6 as each atom is surrounded by six nearest neighbors."

    {
      "question": "What fraction of an atom at a corner of a unit cell belongs to that cell?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1/2",
        "b": "1/4",
        "c": "1/8",
        "d": "1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "An atom at a corner is shared by 8 neighboring unit cells, so only 1/8th of it belongs to a single unit cell."

    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the atomic radius (r) and the edge length (a) in a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "a = 2r",
        "b": "a = 4r/√3",
        "c": "a = √2 * r",
        "d": "a = r"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "In a BCC crystal structure, the diagonal across the cube passes through 4 atomic radii, giving the relationship a = 4r/√3."

        "b": "Body-centered cubic",
        "c": "Simple cubic",
        "d": "Hexagonal close-packed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "The simple cubic structure has the lowest packing efficiency of 52% due to its loose atomic arrangement."
      },

    {
      "question": "How many atoms are present in a single unit cell of a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure?",

        "c": "4",
        "d": "8"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "An FCC unit cell contains 8 corner atoms (each contributing 1/8th) and 6 face atoms (each contributing 1/2), summing to 4 atoms."
