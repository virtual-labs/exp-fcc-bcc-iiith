        "d": "16"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "FCC structures have 12 nearest neighbors for each atom, hence a coordination number of 12."

      "question": "What is the packing efficiency of a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure?",

        "c": "52%",
        "d": "90%"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "BCC structures have a packing efficiency of approximately 68% due to less dense atomic arrangement compared to FCC."

      "question": "If the atomic radius in a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal is 'r', what is the edge length of the unit cell?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "2r",
        "b": "√2 * r",
        "c": "4r/√2",
        "d": "4r/√3"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "The edge length of an FCC unit cell is calculated as 4r/√3 based on the diagonal relationship in the cubic geometry."

        "c": "Face-centered cubic",
        "d": "Hexagonal close-packed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "Hexagonal close-packed (HCP) and FCC structures have the highest packing efficiency of 74%, higher than simple cubic or BCC."

      "question": "What is the Miller index of a plane that cuts through the x-axis at 1a, the y-axis at 2a, and the z-axis at ∞?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "(1 2 0)",

        "d": "(1 1 0)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The reciprocals of intercepts are taken to find the Miller indices: 1/1, 1/2, and 1/∞ result in (1 2 0)."

        "b": "2",
        "c": "4",
        "d": "6"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "BCC contains 1 atom at the center and 1/8th of each of the 8 corner atoms, effectively summing to 2 atoms per unit cell."
