### Aim of the experiment

The aim of this experiment is to identify lattices from repeating patterns. This experiment aims at giving the user a brief understanding of what is a Bravais lattice and the primitive vectors of a Bravais lattice and its connection to the definition of a Bravais lattice. It is expected that the user defines primitive vectors for standard Bravais lattices by the end of this experiment.
